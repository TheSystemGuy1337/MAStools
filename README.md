# MAStools - Toolkit for Monika After Story
A useful set of tools designed to make the lives of MAS players easier.

# Important - Read me first
I have moved on from the Monika After Story community and have no intrest in maintaining this repo. Also, this is a batch script which is held together by duct tape which I wouldn't trust to back up a hard drive. I'm archiving this repo for this exact reason. Also, future updates WILL break MAStools, and MAStools is WINDOWS ONLY.

## What can MAStools do?
- Backup your persistant.
- Backup your entire game.
- Install submods for you (must be extracted to a folder first, see instructions)
- Check affection levels without having to open the logs folder.

The program is completely automatic; simply open it, select one of the tools, and follow the instructions on-screen.

# How to install MAStools
Installation is very simple, simply navigate to releases then download MAStools, then put the .bat file anywhere you want.

## ANTIVIRUS FALSE POSITIVE WARNING

Some antiviruses report MAStools as malware. THIS IS A FALSE POSITIVE. MAStools is completely safe, and always will be. If you are still concerned that MAStools is a virus, please look at the source code above.

## WARNING TO PEOPLE WHO USE GOOGLE CHROME AND HAVE ENHANCED SAFE BROWSING ENABLED
You WILL receive a warning saying the file isn't commonly downloaded and will ask you to send it to Google. DO NOT DO THIS. Instead, discard the download, turn off Safe Browsing temporarily then download MAStools again. When MAStools finishes downloading, turn Safe Browsing back on.

## FAQ
Q: Will the Renpy8 update break MAStools?

A: No. MAStools runs independntly of MAS, so MAStools will continue to work after MAS migrates to RP8.

Q: Do I need to install it to the Submods folder?

A: Absolutely not. You can place this anywhere and it will work just fine. If you really want to, you can still put it in the Submods folder and MAStools work still work fine (however MAS won't recognize it)

Q: How do I install submods using this tool?

A: Before using this utility, read your submods README.md file. Some submods will tell you NOT to put it in your game folder or submods folder.

To install a submod, create a folder, then extract the submod to that folder. Open MAStools, select 3 then follow on screen instructions.

## Minimum system requirements
A PC running Windows XP or later.
