## FAQ
Q: Will the Renpy8 update break MAStools?

A: No. MAStools runs independntly of MAS, so MAStools will continue to work after MAS migrates to RP8.

Q: Do I need to install it to the Submods folder?

A: Absolutely not. You can place this anywhere and it will work just fine. If you really want to, you can still put it in the Submods folder and MAStools work still work fine (however MAS won't recognize it)

Q: How do I install submods using this tool?

A: Before using this utility, read your submods README.md file. Some submods will tell you NOT to put it in your game folder or submods folder.

To install a submod, create a folder, then extract the submod to that folder. Open MAStools, select 3 then follow on screen instructions.
